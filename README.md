# RescueMe
CSE 4471 group project RescueMe.  An application to provide users with a safe, quick, and secure form of alternate emergency contact.

To run RescueMe you will need Android Studio and either the emulator AVM contained within Android Studio or a personal Android phone.  
First clone the project and open it within Android Studio.  Android Studio should inform you if any java updates are required and if they are please update them.
Next either plug your Android phone into your computer with a usb cable or create an emulated phone using the AVM of Android Studio.  The latest versions of everything should work for the emulator.
The next step should be to simply compile and run the program and use it on whichever device you have set up.  Good luck and stay safe!
